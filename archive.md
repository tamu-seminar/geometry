<div id="Lacini" style="display:none;">
A longstanding conjecture of T. Fujita asserts that if $X$ is
a smooth complex projective variety of dimension $n$ and if $L$ is an
ample line bundle, then $K_X+mL$ is basepoint free for $m\geq n+1$. The
conjecture is known up to dimension five by work of Reider, Ein,
Lazarsfeld, Kawamata, Ye and Zhu. In higher dimensions, breakthrough
work of Angehrn, Siu, Helmke and others showed that the conjecture
holds if $m$ is larger than a quadratic function in $n$. We show that for
$n\geq 2$ the conjecture holds for $m$ larger than $n(\log\log(n)+3)$. This is
joint work with L. Ghidelli.

<div id="Faust" style="display:none;">
 Given a periodic graph $G$, we consider a class of discrete periodic operators given by the sum of a weighted adjacency
 operator and a potential. We wish to study the spectrum of this operator acting on the Hilbert space of square-summable
 functions on the vertices of $G$. By Floquet theory, the spectrum can be realized as the projection of a finite number of
 band functions. If one of these band functions is constant, the operator is said to have a flat band, corresponding to
 eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity. In this talk, we will introduce the relevant background and discuss recent results
 that demonstrate that, generically, discrete periodic operators do not exhibit flat bands. This is based on joint work
 with Wencai Liu.

<div id="Lopez" style="display:none;">
A periodic graph operator is a weighted Laplacian plus potential acting on functions on
the vertices of a periodic graph. It is well-known that the spectrum of a periodic graph
operator is the projection of an affine algebraic variety known as the Bloch
variety. Motivated by Bättig, we compactify the Bloch variety of a periodic graph operator
inside the normal toric variety associated to its Newton polytope. For a family of
periodic graphs, we extend this operator to such toric variety by expressing the
compactification as the support of a kernel sheaf. We outline a few spectral-theoretic
consequences of this compactification. This is joint work with Matthew Faust (MSU),
Stephen Shipman (LSU), and Frank Sottile.

<div id="Raychadhury" style="display:none;">
 Secant varieties are classical objects in algebraic
geometry. Given a smooth projective variety inside a projective space,
its secant variety is by definition the closure of the union of secant
lines. It is almost always singular and sits inside the same
projective space by its construction. In this talk, we will discuss
the singularities of secant varieties when the embedding is
sufficiently positive. In particular, we will study the Du Bois
complex of secant varieties and will also discuss about its local
cohomology modules. The results are obtained in various collaborations
with Q. Chen, B. Dirks, S. Olano and L. Song.

 In 1970, N. Tanaka gave a method for assigning a canonical frame to distribution with constant Tanaka symbol.
 In 2009, B. Doubrov and I. Zelenko utilized a symplectification procedure to obtain a canonical frame for distributions independent of their
Tanaka symbol, but an additional condition called maximality of class was required of the
distribution. In a work with I. Zelenko, we recently proved that all rank 2 distributions
with 5-dimensional cube are of maximal class at a generic point; this allowed us to assign
a canonical frame at a generic point to every rank 2 distribution which is not Goursat. In
the rank 2 case, I will give an interpretation of the symplectification procedure in terms of
a classical construction called Cartan prolongation. Time permitting, I will also sketch what
is known about a collection of fundamental invariants called harmonic invariants in the case
of rank 2 distributions in dimensions 6 and 7 along with differential relations called syzygies
satisfied by these invariants.<br>

In contrast to the rank 2 case, we found examples of rank 3 distributions with 6-dimensional
square which are not of maximal class. In particular, I will present a (3, 8) distribution
of nonmaximal class with 29-dimensional symmetry containing a semi-direct sum of the
exceptional Lie group G_2 with a copy of its adjoint module.

In the late 1990s, Llarull proved that the round n-sphere is area-extremal in the sense that one cannot simultaneously increase its scalar curvature and its metric, confirming a rigidity phenomenon anticipated by Gromov. Goette and Semmelmann generalized Llarull’s rigidity result to certain area non-increasing spin maps $f: M \to N$ of nonzero $A$-degree, showing that under an appropriate lower bound on the scalar curvature, the map $f$ must be a Riemannian submersion.

In this talk, I will give a brief introduction to scalar curvature comparison geometry and discuss several generalizations of the Goette–Semmelmann rigidity theorem. In particular, I will present a generalization in which the topological condition on the Â-degree is replaced by a weaker assumption involving the so-called higher mapping degree. I will also describe an ongoing joint project with Oskar Rieder, in which we strengthen the rigidity conclusion: the map $f$ is not only a Riemannian submersion, but the manifold M even splits locally as a Riemannian product of $N$ with a Ricci-flat manifold $F$.
